This project focuses on the use of AWS and IAM to host a fully playable and scalable Minecraft server. Demonstrated skills include use of AWS and IAM configuration and an understanding of cloud computing in relation to server hosting. Specifically, I show my configuration settings, how the server runs on the cloud as well as scaling capabilities for the future which include greater security for the server and modification of the Minecraft server itself.
